# 2.4.1

* Stop reporting the expected value when an `assert.equal` step fails because it's also reported in the step description.

  ```txt
  ✘ Counter should be 666. -- Got 777, expected 666.

  is now

  ✘ Counter should be 666. -- Got 777.
  ```

* Much better handling of multiline string assertion failures

  ```txt
  ✘ Message should be what
  even is this. -- Got what
  the hell is this, expected what
  even is this.

  is now

  ✘ Message should be:
      what
      even is this
    Got:
      what
      the hell is this
  ```
